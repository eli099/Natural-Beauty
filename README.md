# Project Three - Natural Beauty

## Brief

To build a MERN stack application with CRUD functionality as a group.
The app must implement React on the front-end and use Express.js on the backend to serve data from a Mongo database. It must also include at least one relationship and reverse relationship on the backend.

## The Idea

I worked on this project with [Fran Knight](https://github.com/fransurf) and [Ben Cave](https://github.com/bens-cave) and created the main git repository here.

The idea was to create an app focused on areas of Natural Beauty in the UK and that allows users to navigate around a map to access information about national parks. We wanted the user to be able to leave reviews and to add their favourite places to come back to on their own profile page.

## Techonolgies Used

- React
- JSX
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express
- CSS
- SASS

## Tools Used

- Git
- Github
- Trello
- Slack
- Excalidraw

## Our Approach

* We decided to use a Trello board to track our progress and to hold usefull links/resources related to the project.

* After brainstorming ideas together we came to the decision that we would like to incorporate a map of some kind into our app so that users can navigate easily through national park related information. After a recommendation we decided to use Mapbox to implement our idea.

* Initially we each read through Mapbox documentation and did research to find out how to use a map in our app.

* We then delegated tasks daily. Me and Ben focused on figuring out how to use Mapbox and Fran collated the National Park data for our API.

- Backend -> For the remainder of the project I focused on the backend - database schema, middleware, request (get, post, delete) & endpoints, seeding & seed data, routing and part of the authentication process.
  - Front-end -> Navbar, Login, Register and Profile page.

* Fran worked on collating the data we needed for our API - descriptions, links, images etc - and part of user authentication processes on the front and backend.

## Hurdles & Unsolved Problems

- Figuring out how to use Mapbox maps inside our app.

- The ability for a user to add national parks to their favourites list worked initially but a couple houre before presenting, it stopped working. We need to figure out how to fix this bug.

## Stretch Goal

- Improve styling
- Optimise for mobile screens -> make more responsive
- Finish function for adding reviews
- Add function to display avergae rating for each national park
- Expand the API to AONBs (Areas of Natural Beauty)
